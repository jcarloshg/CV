For a Full Stack/Software Architecture role, here are the most critical soft skills I'd look for:

**Communication & Translation** - This is arguably the most important. They need to explain complex technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders, write clear documentation, and translate business requirements into technical solutions. Architecture decisions affect entire teams, so clarity is essential.

**Systems Thinking** - The ability to see the big picture, understand how different components interact, and anticipate downstream effects of design decisions. This includes thinking about scalability, maintainability, and trade-offs.

**Collaboration & Influence** - Architecture roles require getting buy-in from other engineers, leading technical discussions, and building consensus without necessarily having direct authority. They need to mentor developers and guide teams toward good practices.

**Pragmatism & Decision-Making** - Knowing when "good enough" is actually good enough, balancing technical perfection with business needs and deadlines. They should make decisive calls when needed rather than over-engineering or analysis paralysis.

**Adaptability** - Technology stacks evolve constantly. They need intellectual curiosity and comfort with learning new tools, frameworks, and patterns. Also adapability to changing business requirements.

**Ownership & Accountability** - Taking responsibility for the technical health of systems, including the less glamorous work like debugging production issues, addressing technical debt, and supporting other team members.

**Empathy** - Understanding the developer experience, considering how their architectural decisions will impact the team's daily work, and designing systems that are actually pleasant to work with.

What level of seniority are you hiring for? The emphasis on certain skills shifts between mid-level full stack roles versus principal/staff architect positions.
